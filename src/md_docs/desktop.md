While it seems like the world is moving away from desktop applications
in favor of mobile and web, I believe desktop applications will be
around for a long time and are still very interesting. As part of
my past embedded work, I've developed interactive desktop user
interfaces to interact and control scientific instruments. This included
the use of interactive graphs, live updating data, and complex controls.
