Experienced in working in C/C++ in memory and performance
constrained environments. Past experience primarily relied on C++ and Qt
as part of a scientific research team. Tasks and responsibilities ranged from
reverse engineering and integration of proprietary scientific
instruments to off the shelf sensor integration. This project was published in [SPIE](http://proceedings.spiedigitallibrary.org/proceeding.aspx?articleid=2524343) after completion.
