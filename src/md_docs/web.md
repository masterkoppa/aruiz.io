Always researching and learning about the latest technologies in Web. I
enjoy writing clean composable React components using tools like
Webpack, Grunt and Redux for managing large applications. On the backend
I work every day with PHP, but enjoy working on side projects in Python,
Ruby, and NodeJS.
